# Introduction

This library exists for two main reasons. First, because we totally get how much math
visualization can help learning and coding iterations. Second, because its intended to be part of a
larger set of tools to create Math content for the web and other medias.

Also, we're big fans of tools like Desmos. That said, we also realize that moving your
math logic from code to a separate tool can sometimes feel be a
hassle.

Plus, writing in math notation, while worth learning, is a whole skill set on its own.
So, we wanted to bridge the gap, crafting a library for developers like me, that could
bring together the best of coding and Graphing tools without the extra hassle.

This is still a work in progress, but we're excited to share it with
you. We hope you enjoy it!
