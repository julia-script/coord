# Bounding Box Types

`BBox` and `BBoxish` are representations of bounding boxes in a 2D space.

## BBox

The `BBox` type represents a bounding box in a 2D graph space.
It is an `object` that contains two properties, `horizontal` and `vertical`, each of which is a `Vec2` instance.

```typescript
export type BBox = {
  horizontal: Vec2;
  vertical: Vec2;
};
```

- `horizontal` represents the horizontal range of the bounding box, where `x` is the left boundary and `y` is the right boundary.
- `vertical` represents the vertical range of the bounding box, where `x is the lower boundary and `y` is the upper boundary.

## BBoxish

The BBoxish type is a flexible representation of a bounding box.

```typescript
export type BBoxish =
  | {
      horizontal: Vec2ish;
      vertical: Vec2ish;
    }
  | {
      x: Vec2ish;
      y: Vec2ish;
    }
  | [number, number, number, number];
```

- An `object` with horizontal and vertical properties, each of which is a `Vec2ish` type, providing flexibility in defining the ranges.
- An `object` with `x` and `y` properties, where `x` represents the horizontal range and `y` the vertical range. Each property is a `Vec2ish` type.
- A tuple of four numbers, where the numbers represent `[left, bottom, right, top]` boundaries of the bounding box. This is similar to the format used in many graphics and layout systems.
