# Navigation

The way navigation works on `@coord/graph`, is by directly controlling the `coordBox` prop of the `Graph` component, and using the `onCoordBoxChange` callback prop to update it.
We provide a `useNavigationState` hook to make this easier, but keep in mind that this is only a wrapper of the `useState` hook that normalizes the `coordBox` value.

The supported interactions are zooming and panning. Hold Ctrl to zoom with the mouse/trackpad scroll.

```tsx live
import { Graph, Grid, Plot, useNavigationState } from "@coord/graph";

export default function MyGraph() {
  const [coordBox, setCoordBox] = useNavigationState();

  return (
    <Graph
      coordBox={coordBox}
      onCoordBoxChange={setCoordBox}
      height={300}
      width="100%"
    >
      <Grid />
      <Plot.ofX f={(x) => Math.sin(x)} />
    </Graph>
  );
}
```
