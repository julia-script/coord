# Line Component

`Line` is as simple as it seems a component that takes two points and draws a
line between them.

```tsx live
import * as React from "react";
import { Graph, Grid, Line, useCoordState, Marker } from "@coord/graph";

export default function MyGraph() {
  const [p0, setP0] = useCoordState([-4, -4]);
  const [p1, setP1] = useCoordState([4, 4]);
  return (
    <Graph width="100%" height="100%">
      <Grid />
      <Line from={p0} to={p1} strokeColor={5} />
      <Marker position={p0} onChange={setP0} color={5} />
      <Marker position={p1} onChange={setP1} color={5} />
    </Graph>
  );
}
```
